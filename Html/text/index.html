    <!-- paragraph tag in html -->
    <p>
        A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
        that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
        start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
        line.
    </p>
    <p>
        Text is easier to understand when it is split up
        into units of text. For example, a book may have
        chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
        each heading there will be one or more
        paragraphs.

    <!-- Bold tag in html -->

    </p>
